      - "Women holding at least a bachelor’s degree now outnumber men, but when we look at the highest-paying industries, women are very much underrepresented. Not only are their employment levels low relative to their male counterparts, but women who work in those industries also earn much less than men even when accounting for occupation."
      - "According to data from the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, people working in the securities industry have the highest average earnings, followed by workers in software publishing, other information services, computer manufacturing, and oil and gas extraction—all industries where the majority of employees are men. Of these high-paying industries, only in the securities industry are more than a third (36.5%) of the employees female.<<foot note=1>>"

  - description: "In the securities industries grouping, women make only about half of what men earn: $80,554 as compared to $156,841. Now some of this difference is accounted for by occupation, but certainly not all. Of the five largest occupational categories within the securities industry, women only hold the majority of positions among secretaries and administrative assistants, where they dominate, holding 97% of those jobs. But those 1,675 male administrative assistants earn an average of $67,552 as compared to the average of $46,558 earned by more than 51,000 female administrative assistants—a pattern repeated in the other top occupational categories in this industry."
