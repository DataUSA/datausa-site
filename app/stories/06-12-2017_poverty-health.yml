      - "Why are some people healthier than others? Is it simply a product of genetics, lifestyle choices, and access to modern medicine? It turns out it’s a lot more complicated than that."
      - "A growing body of research has shown that socioeconomic factors, often referred to as the social determinants of health — including poverty, education, and neighborhood factors — can have a major impact on health outcomes.<<foot note=1>> But how tightly does any single health determinant track with poor health? DataUSA allows us to compare various socioeconomic and environmental factors to answer that question."

      - "These summary statistics on poverty, air pollution, and access to exercise opportunities reinforce the associations already established in the literature. But the trend lines also show that of these three factors, poverty is the strongest indicator. In fact, poverty is positively associated with a range of health measures, including physical health, mental health, diabetes prevalence, and low birth weight."

      - "DataUSA also allows us to see which states and counties fare best and worst on these health outcomes. In 2015, for three out of four of these metrics, a county in the southern United States led the nation with the poorest health outcome:"

      - "Of course, poverty is a broad socioeconomic factor that’s at the root of many others associated with poor health. Cost can pose a barrier to factors that allow people to live a healthy lifestyle such as accessing health care<<foot note=4>> and healthy food.<<foot note=5>> Moreover, people with low socioeconomic status are more likely to live in areas with higher concentrations of air pollution.<<foot note=6>> In other words, poverty can cause cumulative disadvantages that can negatively impact health."
      - "Genetics, lifestyle choices, and access to modern medicine all play obvious roles in determining our overall health. The cumulative disadvantage of poverty may not come to mind as readily, but its role in health outcomes is no less critical."
